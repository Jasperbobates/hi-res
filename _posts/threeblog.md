  In 2019, I travelled to Bhutan to meet with policymakers and community leaders. Learning about their way of life and vision for Bhutanese governance motivated me to share some of my thoughts regarding this small and unique country in the middle of the Himalayas.

The Gross Domestic Product (GDP) has received criticism for its limitations in measuring economic performance. As economist Joseph Stiglitz pointed out: "when you have growing inequality in society you can have GDP going up, but the median income, meaning 50% or more of people are getting worse off". In other words, what it fails to identify is the well-being of a population. As a result, an entirely new discussion around how to measure sustainable development has arisen. That became the precedent for the recent IE transformational journey to the country of Bhutan, where fifteen students from the international relations program set out on a two-week trip to learn about a fascinating new way to think about development, namely, the Gross National Happiness (GNH).

The rationale behind the GNH is surprisingly simple: the duty of the government is to keep its people happy and improve their well-being. However, it could only take a vision of a young and progressive king, specifically, 4th dragon king Jigme Singye Wangchuk, to transform this idea into a philosophy for development. King Wangchuk, at the tender age of 24, recognized the increased inequality and depletion of common-pool resources that similar developing countries experienced when taking a purely economic growth strategy. The first-ever mention of the GNH came during an interview with the Financial Times in 1979, where Wangchuk suggested including happiness in the way we think about development. Since then, the Bhutanese government has used this vision as a tool for development. It was not until 1998 that prime minister Jigme Y. Thinley openly shared the philosophy with the world. At that point, it was an idea that seemed overly idealistic and intangible to many.   

While it rapidly gained popularity, Bhutanese officials still had not found an answer to the question of how to measure something as abstract as happiness. The plan of turning this into something quantifiable started in 2005, resulting in the nine domains, 33 different indicators, and over 100 sub-indicators that make up the GNH. Finding fulfillment in all of these domains was considered integral to the happiness of the individual. Some were straightforward, such as health, education, and good governance. Others were unconventional, such as measuring cultural diversity, psychological well-being, and community vitality.  

Today, the GNH has left a large imprint on the country. One example of this is the effect that it has had on the governance of Bhutan. Being fully committed to his creation, the king voluntarily handed the sovereignty over to his people in 2006, less than a year after implementing the index. The domain concerned with governance, which highlights the importance of political participation and fundamental rights to individual happiness, became the catalyst for this radical decision. Two years later, the first democratic elections were held, which marked a new era for the East-Asian country.

Another example is the environment. The domain of ecological diversity relates unhappiness with the ecological upheavals and wildlife damage that we are facing. As a result, Bhutan has become a global leader in environmental protection. Today the country has more than 70% forest cover and is the only carbon-neutral country. 

Although Bhutan sounds like a fairy-tale story, some misconceptions continue to surround it. Bhutan is the first country to use GNH as a policy device and a philosophy for development. That does not mean that they are the happiest country in the world. Furthermore, despite their commitment to gross national happiness, they also recognize the importance of GDP as a measurement of growth. Its economy has grown six-fold since the start of the century, but the desire for a strong GDP has not come at the expense of gross national happiness. Lastly, the GNH is by no means absolute or complete. Instead, it should be considered a work in progress to be adapted to the culture of each country.  

The GNH has served Bhutan not only as a measurement tool for happiness but as a standard for development, a policy shaper, and an identity. It has put them on the map and made them distinct, which for a country sandwiched between two global giants has been vital for their continued survival and prosperity.
