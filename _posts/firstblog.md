title: Why Norway’s effort to clean up its dirty energy is causing controversy
preview: >-
  What does a green transition actually look like? In the case of Norway, it seems to mean a deepening in capital investments in fossil fuels. Behind what appears to be a contentious policy, there may lie a silver lining.

### In the waning hours of the 28th Conference of the Parties (COP28) in Dubai, 198 parties agreed for the first time to ‘transition away’ from fossil fuels. Despite a meaningful step forward, the wording reveals a cautious commitment to combating climate change: a ‘phasing out’ remains out of reach. The current agreement signals a declining, but continued importance of fossil fuels for the future global energy mix, much to the relief of most oil and gas dependent countries.

### Such is the case for Norway, who recently reaffirmed its plan to electrify its offshore oil and gas platforms to cut emissions. The ruling Labor Party and the state-owned oil company Equinor claim electrifying their continental shelf will reduce emissions from the oil and gas industry by 40% by 2030 and fully by 2050, a meaningful step in meeting Norway’s emission reduction targets of 55% by 2030 and 95% by 2050 compared to 1990 levels. While electrifying the Norwegian oil and gas industry might support the country’s environmental commitments, its estimated $5.2 billion price tag will make any future transition away from fossil fuel production harder.

### Deepening investments in fossil fuels at a time when ambitions for climate action fly high has left no shortage of critics. In a public statement last year, the Environmental Party dismissed the policy as “nonsense,” noting that “98% of emissions occur during combustion, not on the platforms,” and accusing the project of “greenwashing” the oil industry. Furthermore, critics argue that focusing on electrifying oil platforms could kill green projects in other sectors with potentially higher net value for society.

### The resulting increase in energy demand would also put added pressure on already surging domestic energy prices. Figures estimate that if planned electrification projects become realized, oil production could consume as much as 17 TWh per year – over 10% of Norway’s yearly energy production and all of its generated wind energy. Indeed, initial reports from recently completed electrification projects report both higher electricity prices and green financing constraints in regions where electrification would take place. 

### The combined concern for the environmental costs and rising energy prices has created an unlikely political alliance. The right-wing Progress Party, driven by concerns over wasteful spending and high energy prices has staunchly opposed electrification, alongside the centrist Environmental Party and the far-left Red Party. At the same time, Labor Party leader and Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Store’s commitment has wavered. Commenting on the COP28 agreement, Store initially announced that future electrification projects would become increasingly more difficult to realize. Already last October, however, he gave Equinor the green light to start electrifying new platforms in the North Sea. In the face of strong cross-party opposition, this political gamble could prove costly for the Labor Party.


### While the potential decrease in green investments in other sectors might lead to negligible effects nationally, it may yet support large reductions globally. Europe’s shift away from Russian gas in the aftermath of the Russia-Ukraine war has positioned neighboring Norway as a key strategic supplier. The portion of Norwegian gas revenues directly attributable to the war is estimated to have reached 334 billion kroner ($34.7 billion) in 2022 and made up 30% of the total import of the EU by 2023. 

### With Norway playing a growing role for Europe’s energy demands, the electrification policy is becoming increasingly relevant for global climate efforts. One estimate suggests that the Norwegian oil and gas industry, which is tied to the EU emissions trading scheme may reduce European emissions by as much as 80% of the emissions cuts achieved in Norway. One reason is Europe’s increased import of Norwegian gas enabled by the North Sea pipelines, substituting liquefied natural gas, which is associated with higher emissions, both in production and transportation. Importantly, the EU holds significant leverage over the Norwegian energy strategy: as it continues to raise prices of carbon allowances, it may accelerate the push towards electrification of the Norwegian continental shelf.

### Achieving full electrification of the Norwegian continental shelf remains nonetheless a distant dream. Of the 92 active oil platforms, only 7 have been fully electrified with 6 more in the works. And with a new round of COP approaching in Baku as well as next year’s parliamentary elections looming overhead, Store’s ambitious plan may collapse at the starting block.
