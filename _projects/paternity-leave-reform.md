### Policy context

In June 2020, a new Dutch paternity leave reform was instituted. The extended paternal leave policy (AGV), provides fathers with five additional weeks of paid leave in addition to the one-week standard leave. Fathers can choose if and when they want to take this leave within a six-month period. They are provided 70% of their base salary through the benefit scheme and employers are given the option to top up the remainder.

### Project overview

Our research team received registration data from the Employee Insurance Agency (UWV) and labor data from the Central Statistical Bureau of the Netherlands (CBS). I prepared the statistical analysis by merging the two datasets and creating easy-to-use replication files for the research team.

### Research Methodology

The study employed:
- **Longitudinal data analysis** 
- **Regression discontinuity design** around the cutoff date 

### Preliminary Findings

- **Networking effects**: A father taking additional leave increases the likelihood of their colleagues taking it as well.
- **Seasonal variations**: Take-up rates are lower during summer seasons and higher during winter seasons.
- **Heterogeneity**: Large heterogeneity in take-up across income deciles, ethnic background, contract type, and age of the father.
