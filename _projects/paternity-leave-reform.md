### Project Overview

This research project examines how recent reforms to Dutch parental leave policies have affected fathers' uptake of paternity leave and broader gender equality outcomes.

### Policy Context

The Netherlands recently reformed its parental leave system to encourage more equitable sharing of childcare responsibilities between parents. This study tracks the real-world impact of these changes.

### Research Methodology

The study employed:
- Longitudinal data analysis from household surveys
- Statistical modeling of take-up rates
- Comparative analysis before and after reform
- Qualitative interviews with families

### Key Findings

The research revealed significant changes in paternity leave uptake following the reform, with important implications for:
- Gender equality in the workplace
- Child development outcomes
- Work-life balance
- Economic productivity

### Data Visualization

Custom visualizations were created to communicate findings effectively to policy makers and the public, showing clear trends in take-up rates across different demographic groups.

### Policy Implications

The findings provide evidence-based insights for future policy refinements and have contributed to ongoing discussions about family leave policies in the Netherlands and beyond.
