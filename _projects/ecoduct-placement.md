### Project Background

This project analyzes wildlife movement patterns and road infrastructure to determine optimal placement of ecoducts in the Gooi region.

### Why Ecoducts Matter

Wildlife crossings are essential for:
- Maintaining biodiversity
- Reducing wildlife-vehicle collisions
- Connecting fragmented habitats
- Supporting ecosystem health

### Analysis Approach

The study utilized:
- Wildlife tracking data
- Traffic flow analysis
- Habitat connectivity modeling
- Cost-benefit analysis

### Results

The analysis identified several high-priority locations for ecoduct placement, balancing ecological needs with infrastructure constraints and budget considerations.

### Tools & Technologies

- GIS mapping software
- Ecological modeling frameworks
- Spatial statistics
