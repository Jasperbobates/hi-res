# Videos Directory

This directory is for storing video files for the TNO page.

## Supported Formats
- MP4 (recommended for best compatibility)
- WebM (good for modern browsers)
- MOV (QuickTime format)

## Usage
1. Add your video file(s) to this directory
2. Update the video source path in `_posts/tno.md` if needed
3. The video will be displayed with controls and responsive styling

## Example
```
/videos/personal_video.MOV
/videos/personal_video.mp4
/videos/personal_video.webm
```

## File Size Considerations
- Keep video files reasonably sized for web delivery
- Consider using video compression tools if files are too large
- For very large videos, consider using a CDN or video hosting service
